# Code Style

## Must
- "Use const by default; let when reassignment is required"
- "No var; no implicit globals"
- "Prefer early returns over nested conditionals"
- "Function length <= 50 lines in controllers/services; extract helpers"
- "File length <= 300 lines; split modules when exceeding"

## Should
- "Apply Prettier formatting; 2-space indent; single quotes; trailing commas where valid"
- "JSDoc or TSDoc for public functions and complex logic"
