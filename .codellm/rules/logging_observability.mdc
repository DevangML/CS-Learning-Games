# Logging & Observability

## Must
- "Use structured logging (pino or winston) with levels and requestId"
- "Mask PII and secrets in logs"
- "Add request logging middleware for method, path, status, latency"

## Should
- "Expose basic metrics (request count, latency, errors) and DB health"
- "Integrate distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to trace requests across services."
- "Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for key user journeys and set up alerting."

## Avoid
- "Logging sensitive user data in plain text."
- "Using generic log messages that lack context."
