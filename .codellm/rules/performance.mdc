# Performance

## Must
- "Cache-control for static assets; use express.static with long maxAge for hashed files"
- "Use gzip/brotli compression for text responses"
- "Paginate or cap query results rendered in the UI (<= 200 rows)"

## Should
- "Debounce frequent UI updates; reuse DOM nodes where possible"
- "Pool DB connections and reuse prepared statements"
