# Frontend

## Must
- "Avoid inline onclick/on* handlers in HTML; bind events in JS modules"
- "Avoid innerHTML with unsanitized data; prefer textContent or sanitize explicitly"
- "Minimize global window.* exports; encapsulate modules and expose only one app entry"

## Should
- "Adopt ESLint + Prettier with a consistent style (airbnb/base or standard)"
- "Consider TypeScript migration for shared types (API payloads, state)"
- "Use feature modules (auth, gameState, onboarding, router) with clear interfaces"

## Avoid
- "Cross-module DOM mutations without an explicit API or event bus"
