# Agent Workflow

- "Before changing code: read impacted files and summarize intent, risks, and testability"
- "Propose a minimal plan with diffs or file list, get confirmation for large refactors"
- "Prefer incremental, self-contained PRs"
- "Write or update tests for changed code paths"
- "Run linters/formatters and update docs"
