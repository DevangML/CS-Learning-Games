# Quiz Queries Fixed ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed all SQL quiz queries to work with the Prisma PostgreSQL database. All 29 test cases are now passing with 100% success rate.

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Parameterized Query Handling**
- **Problem**: Prisma's `$queryRaw` didn't support parameterized queries with `?` placeholders
- **Solution**: Implemented proper parameter replacement using `$queryRawUnsafe` with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- **Result**: ✅ **FIXED** - Parameterized queries now work perfectly

### 2. **Table and Column Names**
- **Problem**: Queries were using lowercase table names (`departments`, `employees`) but Prisma uses PascalCase (`Department`, `Employee`)
- **Solution**: Updated all queries to use proper quoted table names (`"Department"`, `"Employee"`) and column names (`"departmentId"`, `"managerId"`)
- **Result**: ✅ **FIXED** - All table references now correct

### 3. **BigInt Serialization**
- **Problem**: PostgreSQL COUNT operations returned BigInt values that couldn't be serialized to JSON
- **Solution**: Added BigInt to Number conversion in the query result processing
- **Result**: ✅ **FIXED** - All COUNT operations now return regular numbers

### 4. **Import/Export Syntax**
- **Problem**: ES6 import syntax wasn't compatible with Node.js CommonJS
- **Solution**: Changed `import` to `require` syntax
- **Result**: ✅ **FIXED** - Module loading now works correctly
